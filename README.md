# sr-finetune
 Super-Resolution project expands upon my Master's thesis, which used pre-trained SR models for inferencing. This project attempts to fine-tune the pre-trained models for face and text image enhancement using the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset (FFHQ) and SCUT-CTW1500, a curved text dataset.
 
 A Google Drive link is provided showing the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and visual results from inferencing the pre-trained and finetuned Real-ESRGAN and SwinIR Super-Resolution models with image benchmarks datasets, Set5 and Set14, and the Vimeo-90K test set, a video Super-Resolution dataset of video frames extracted as images.
