# sr-finetune
 Super-Resolution project expands upon my Master's thesis, which used pre-trained SR models for inferencing. This project attempts to fine-tune the pre-trained models for face and text image enhancement using the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset (FFHQ) and SCUT-CTW1500, a curved text dataset.
 
 A Google Drive link is provided showing the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and visual results from inferencing the pre-trained and finetuned Real-ESRGAN and SwinIR Super-Resolution models. [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HnPhSydsVox-Ds2FI-l06Jstp2XGxTvw?usp=sharing)
